                <p>
                    The study of computers and computational systems is known as computer science. It is a 
                    broad field that includes everything from software algorithms to how software interacts 
                    with hardware to how well software is developed and designed. Computer scientists study 
                    computer processes and create new software and systems by employing a variety of 
                    mathematical algorithms, coding procedures, and expert programming skills.
